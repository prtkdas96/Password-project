Progress:-
1) As of now, I have only been able to generate the hash for a particular input using SHA256.


2) I have decided to make a java swing app and then connect it to the university database using JDBC. I am studying JDBC and analysing the ways through which I can connect the JDBC to the university database.


3) The java swing app will have a normal white background with three input blank spaces. In the first blank space, we have to first input the sap-id, while the second blank space will take the last 4 digits of the mobile number. In the last and final blank space, the password for that particular user will be generated. The new password will then be updated to the university database. After the use of this application, every student will have a seperate password for the student portal. 

Motivation:-
This project will help the portal to increase its security features so that only authorised users are able to access their respective portals.
